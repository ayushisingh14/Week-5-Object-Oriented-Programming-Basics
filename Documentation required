        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.isbn = isbn
        self.available = True
class Member:
    def __init__(self, name, member_id):
        self.name = name
        self.member_id = member_id
        self.borrowed_books = []
        self.max_books = 5
class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = {}
